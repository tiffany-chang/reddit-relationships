## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

text = rel$Title
text_df = data_frame(line = 1:length(text), text = text)
text_lower = tolower(text_df$text)
```

## Questions to Answer

Here are some iniial questions we are trying to answer:

+ What are the ages and genders of those involved?
+ How long have they been together? 
+ What are the most common words? 
+ What is the sentiment in the posts? 
+ What kind of relationships are there? (husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, brother, sister, etc.)
+ What are the differences in how men and women describe their relationship problems?

## What are the ages and genders of those involved?

These are the main patterns for indicating age and gender in the posts. They are often enclosed by parenthesis ( ) or square brackets [ ]:

+ Age and then Gender - i.e. "25 F", "30M"
+ Age/Gender - i.e. "25/F", "30/M" 
+ Gender and then Age - i.e. "F 25", "M30"
+ Gender/Age - i.e. "F/25", "M/30"

What we want to do is extract the ages and genders by identifying these patterns in each post, using regex.

First, we'll identify the first pattern, where the age comes before gender. Let's break down what the regex means: 

+ **(\\(|\\[){1}** - Match ( or [ once. 
+ **[[:digit:]]{1,3}** - Match a digit between 1 and 3 times. 
+ ** */* * ** - Match 0 or more spaces, match 0 or more slashes, then match 0 or more spaces.
+ **(m|f)+** - Match m or f at least once. 
+ **(\\)|\\]){1}** - Match ) or ] once.

```{r }
age_gender_pattern_v1 = "(\\(|\\[){1}[[:digit:]]{1,3} */* *(m|f)+(\\)|\\]){1}"

age_gender_all_v1 = str_extract_all(text_lower, age_gender_pattern_v1, simplify = TRUE)

head(age_gender_all_v1)
```

Now, let's check which rows are blank. These did not get extracted properly:

```{r }
age_gender_all_v1_not_blank = which(age_gender_all_v1[,1] != "")

age_gender_all_v1_blank = which(age_gender_all_v1[,1] == "")

```

Now, let's repeat for the pattern in which gender comes before age. This pattern is much less common the previous pattern. The logic is the same: 

```{r }
age_gender_pattern_v2 = "(\\(|\\[){1}(m|f)+ */* *[[:digit:]]{1,3}(\\)|\\]){1}"

age_gender_all_v2 = str_extract_all(text_lower, age_gender_pattern_v2, simplify = TRUE)

age_gender_all_v2_not_blank = which(age_gender_all_v2[,1] != "")

age_gender_all_v2_blank = which(age_gender_all_v2[,1] == "")

```

Let's check which rows are still missing after extracting using both of these patterns:

```{r }
all_indices = 1:length(text_lower)

still_missing = all_indices[!((all_indices %in% age_gender_all_v1_not_blank) | (all_indices %in% age_gender_all_v2_not_blank))]

text_lower[still_missing]
```

In these cases, it looks like they used a unique pattern or did not include their age or gender. We can ignore these cases for now.

First, let's melt the dataframes so we can retain the row numbers (i.e. the post number): 

```{r }
age_gender_all_v1_melt = setNames(melt(age_gender_all_v1), c("row", "col", "value"))
head(age_gender_all_v1_melt)
```

```{r }
age_gender_all_v2_melt = setNames(melt(age_gender_all_v2), c("row", "col", "value"))
head(age_gender_all_v2_melt)
```

Now, we'll bind the two dataframes together: 

```{r }
age_gender_all_combined_df = rbind(age_gender_all_v1_melt, age_gender_all_v2_melt)
age_gender_all_combined_df$value = as.character(age_gender_all_combined_df$value)
head(age_gender_all_combined_df)
```

We'll extract the rows that are not blank:

```{r }
age_gender_all_combined_df = age_gender_all_combined_df[which(age_gender_all_combined_df[,3] != ""),]
head(age_gender_all_combined_df)
```

Now, let's extract the ages and genders separately so we can look at the distributions of each.

```{r }
age = str_extract_all(age_gender_all_combined_df[,3], "[[:digit:]]{1,2}", simplify = TRUE)
age = as.numeric(age)
gender = str_extract_all(age_gender_all_combined_df[,3], "(m|f){1}", simplify = TRUE) 
```

Let's add age and gender to the dataframe: 

```{r }
age_gender_all_combined_df = cbind(age_gender_all_combined_df, age, gender)
head(age_gender_all_combined_df)
```

Now, let's plot the distribution of the ages and genders in these posts:

```{r }
pl = ggplot(age_gender_all_combined_df, aes(x=age))
pl + geom_histogram(binwidth=2, colour="white", fill="grey") + theme_minimal()
```

```{r }
# Draw with black outline, white fill
pl = ggplot(age_gender_all_combined_df, aes(x=gender, fill=gender))
pl + geom_bar() + theme_minimal()
```

Now, let's plot the distribution of age by gender:

```{r }
# Get ggplot 2 colors:
gg_color_hue <- function(n) {
  hues = seq(15, 375, length = n + 1)
  hcl(h = hues, l = 65, c = 100)[1:n]
}
```

```{r }
pl = ggplot(filter(age_gender_all_combined_df, gender == "f"), aes(x=age))
pl + geom_histogram(binwidth=1, colour="white", fill=gg_color_hue(1)) + theme_minimal()
```

```{r }
pl = ggplot(filter(age_gender_all_combined_df, gender == "m"), aes(x=age))
pl + geom_histogram(binwidth=1, colour="white", fill=gg_color_hue(2)[2]) + theme_minimal()
```

## How long have they been together? 

Now let's see how they have been together. Usually, the pattern looks like a 1-2 digit number followed by a word for months or years:

```{r }
longevity_pattern_v1 = "[[:digit:]]{1,2} *(months|mo|year|years|yr|yrs){1}"
longevity_v1 = str_extract_all(text_lower, longevity_pattern_v1, simplify = TRUE)
head(longevity_v1)
```

Let's extract the rows that are not blank:

```{r }
longevity_v1_not_blank = which(longevity_v1[,1] != "")
longevity_together = longevity_v1[longevity_v1_not_blank,1]
head(longevity_together)
```

Now, let's extract the number and time unit separately: 

```{r }
num = str_extract_all(longevity_together, "[[:digit:]]{1,2}", simplify = TRUE)
mo_yr = str_extract_all(longevity_together, "(months|mo|year|years|yr|yrs){1}", simplify = TRUE) 
```

Let's create a dataframe with the post number, the longevity of the relationship, the number, and the time unit: 

```{r }
longevity_together_df = data.frame(post_num = longevity_v1_not_blank, longevity_together, num, mo_yr)
longevity_together_df$num = as.numeric(as.character(longevity_together_df$num))
head(longevity_together_df)
```

Let's convert everything to years: 

```{r }
longevity_together_in_years = sapply(1:dim(longevity_together_df)[1], function(i) {
  if (longevity_together_df$mo_yr[i] %in% c("months","mo")) {
    return(longevity_together_df$num[i] / 12)
  } else {
    return(longevity_together_df$num[i])
  }
})

longevity_together_in_years = round(longevity_together_in_years,2)
longevity_together_df = cbind(longevity_together_df, longevity_together_in_years)
head(longevity_together_df)
```

Now, let's plot the distribution of the longevity of the relationship in these posts:

```{r }
# Draw with black outline, white fill
pl = ggplot(longevity_together_df, aes(x=longevity_together_in_years))
pl + geom_histogram(binwidth=1, colour="white", fill="grey") + theme_minimal()
```

We need to create a data set with 

+ Line Number
+ Word
+ Sentiment
+ Line

```{r }
longevity_together_df_v1 = longevity_together_df %>% 
  rename(line = 'post_num') %>%
  inner_join(text_df)

head(longevity_together_df_v1)
```

```{r }
write.csv(longevity_together_df_v1, file = "longevity_together_df_v1.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```

## What are the most common words? 

Now, we will begin our analysis of the text itself. Text Mining with R (https://www.tidytextmining.com/) provides a great guide for this.

First, we'll split each row so that there is one token (word) in each row of the new data frame:

```{r }
tidy_text = text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

Let's make sure to remove stop words: 

```{r }
data(stop_words)

tidy_text = tidy_text %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

Let's find the most common words: 

```{r }
most_common_words = tidy_text %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) 

head(most_common_words, 20)
```

Let's remove any words with numbers, as these are most likely the age/gender patterns:

```{r }
most_common_words_v2 = filter(most_common_words, !str_detect(word, "[[:digit:]]+"))

head(most_common_words_v2, 50)
```

## What is the sentiment in the posts? 

From Text Mining with R (https://www.tidytextmining.com/):

> The tidytext package contains several sentiment lexicons in the sentiments dataset.

> Dictionary-based methods like the ones we are discussing find the total sentiment of a piece of text by adding up the individual sentiment scores for each word in the text.

```{r }
post_sentiment = tidy_text %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(line, sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

head(post_sentiment, 10)
```

Let's find the most common positive and negative words:

```{r }
bing_word_counts = tidy_text %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

head(bing_word_counts)
```

```{r }
bing_word_counts %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(15) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL) +
  coord_flip()
```

We need to create a data set with 

+ Line Number
+ Word
+ Sentiment
+ Line

```{r }
most_common_words_df_v1 = tidy_text %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  inner_join(text_df)

head(most_common_words_df_v1)
```

```{r }
write.csv(most_common_words_df_v1, file = "most_common_words_df_v1.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```

We also need to create a data set with 

+ Word
+ Negative or Positive
+ Contribution to sentiment

```{r }
most_common_words_df_v2 = bing_word_counts

head(most_common_words_df_v2)
```

```{r }
write.csv(most_common_words_df_v2, file = "most_common_words_df_v2.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```

## What kind of relationships are there? (husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, brother, sister, etc.)

Let's create a list of relationship words. List of relationship words from: 

http://www.vocabulary.cl/english/family-members.htm

```{r }
immediate_family_words = c("father", "dad", "mother", "mom", "son", "daughter", "brother", "sister", "parents")
marriage_dating_words = c("boyfriend", "bf", "girlfriend", "gf", "fiance", "fiancee", "husband", "wife")
ex_marriage_dating_words_v1 = paste("ex-", marriage_dating_words, sep="")
ex_marriage_dating_words_v2 = paste("ex ", marriage_dating_words, sep="")
relatives_words = c("grandparents", "grandfather", "grandpa", "grandmother", "grandma", "grandchildren", "grandson", "granddaughter", "great grandfather", "grand grandpa", "great grandmother", "great grandma")
extended_family_words = c("uncle", "aunt", "cousin", "nephew", "niece")
in_laws_words = c("father-in-law", "mother-in-law", "son-in-law", "daughter-in-law", "brother-in-law", "sister-in-law")
family_mix_words = c("stepfather", "stepdad", "stepmother", "stepmom", "stepson", "stepdaughter", "stepsister", "stepbrother", "half-brother", "half-sister")
friend_other_words = c("friend", "best friend", "roommate")

relationship_words = c(immediate_family_words, marriage_dating_words, ex_marriage_dating_words_v1, ex_marriage_dating_words_v2, relatives_words, extended_family_words, in_laws_words, family_mix_words, friend_other_words)
```

Now, let's extract all of the relationship words from the text, and look at the top words:

```{r }
rel_words_test = paste(paste(relationship_words, collapse="|"), "{1}", sep="")

rel_v1 = str_extract_all(text_lower, rel_words_test, simplify = TRUE)

rel_v1_not_blank = which(rel_v1[,1] != "")

# text_lower[rel_v1_not_blank]

rel_v1_melt = melt(rel_v1)

colnames(rel_v1_melt) = c("post_number", "person_number", "relationship")

is.na(rel_v1_melt$relationship) = rel_v1_melt$relationship==''

top_rel_words = count(rel_v1_melt, relationship, sort = TRUE)

top_rel_words
```

```{r }
# Bar graph of counts
ggplot(data=rel_v1_melt, aes(x=relationship)) +
  geom_bar(stat="count")

# Bar graph of counts
ggplot(data=rel_v1_melt[!is.na(rel_v1_melt$relationship),], aes(x=relationship)) +
  geom_bar(stat="count", fill = "grey") + theme_minimal()
```
